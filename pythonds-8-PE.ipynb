    "objectives:\n",
    "- To learn what a graph is and how it is used\n",
    "- To implement the graph abstract data type using multiple internal representation\n",
    "- To see how graph can be used to solve wide variety of problems\n",
    "Graphs can be used to represent many interesting things about our world, including systems of roads, airline flights from city to city, how the Internet is connected, or even the sequence of classes you must take to complete a major in computer science.\n",
    "## vocabulary and definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vertex**:\n",
    "A vertex(also called a \"node\") is a fundamental part of a graph. It can have a name, which we will call the \"key\". A vertex may also have additional information. we will call this additional information the \"payload.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edge**:\n",
    "An edge(also called an \"arc\") is another fundamental part of a graph. An edge connects two vertices to show that there is a relationship between them. Edges may be one-way or two-way. if the edges in a graph are all one-way, we way that the graph is **directed graph**, or a **digraph**. The class prerequisites graph show above is clearly a digraph since you must take some classes before others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weight**:\n",
    "Edges may be weighted to show that there is a cost to go from one vertex to another. For example in a graph of roads that connect one city to another, the weight on the edge might represent the distance between the two cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "With those definitions in hand we can formally define a graph. A graph can be represented by G where G = (V,E). For the graph G, V is a set of vertices and E is a set of edges. Each edge is a tuple(v,w) where w,v belongs to V. We can add a third component to the edge tuple to represent a weight. A subgraph s is a set of edges e and vertices v such that e is included into E and v is included into V.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent this graph as the set of six vertices:\n",
    "V = {V0, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5}\n",
    "\n",
    "and the set of nine edges:\n",
    "E = {(v0,v1,5),(v1,v2,4),(v2,v3,9),(v3,v4,7),(v4,v0,1),(v0,v5,2),(v5,v4,8),(v3,v5,3),(v5,v2,1)}\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "graph LR\n",
    "  V3 --|7| V4\n",
    "  V3 --|3| V5\n",
    "  V2 --|9| V3\n",
    "  V4 --|1| V0\n",
    "  V5 --|8| V4\n",
    "  V5 --|1| V2\n",
    "  V0 --|2| V5\n",
    "  V0 --|5| V1\n",
    "  V1 --|4| V2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Path**:\n",
    "A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices that are connected by edges. Formally we would define a path as w1, w2, ..., wn such that (wi,wi+1) belongs to E for all 1 <= i <=  n-1.  The unweighted path length is the number of edges in the path, specifically n-1. The weighted path length is the sum of the weights of all the edges in the path. For example in figure above the path from V3 to V1 is the sequence of vertices (V3, V4, V0, V1). The edges are {(v3,v4,7), (v4,v0,1), (v0,v1,5)}.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cycle**:\n",
    "A cycle in a directed graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. For example, in Figure above the path (V5, V2, V3, V5) is a cycle. A graph with no cycles is called an **acyclic graph**. A directed graph with no cycles is called a **directed acyclic graph** or a **DAG**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Graph Abstract Data Type\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph abstract data type (ADT) is defined as follows:\n",
    "- `Graph()` creates a new, empty graph.\n",
    "- `addVertex(vert)` adds an instance of `Vertex` to the graph.\n",
    "- `addEdge(fromVert, toVert)` Adds a new, weighted, directed edge to the graph that connects two vertices.\n",
    "- `getVertex(vertKey)` finds the vertex in the graph named `vertkey`\n",
    "- `getVertices()` returns the list of all vertices in the graph.\n",
    "- `in` returns `True` for a statement of the form `vertex in graph`. If the given vertex is in the graph, `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this above formal definition of a graph, there are several ways to implement the graph ADT in python. We will see that there are trade-offs in using different representations to implement the ADT described above.\n",
    "There are two well-known implementations of a graph, \n",
    "- **Adjacency matrix**\n",
    "- **Adjacency list**\n",
    "\n",
    "### An Adjacency Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the easiest ways to implement a graph is to use two-dimensional matrix, in this matrix implementation, each of the rows and columns represents a vertex in the graph. The value that is stored in the cell at the intersection of row v and column w indicates if there is an edge from vertex v to vertex w.\n",
    "**When two vertices are connected by an edge, we say that they are adjacent.** A value in a cell representes the weight of the edge from vertex v to vertex w.\n",
    "\n",
    "|    | V0 | V1 | V2 | v3 | V4 | v5 |\n",
    "|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n",
    "| V0 |    | 5  |    |    |    | 2  |\n",
    "| V1 |    |    | 4  |    |    |    |\n",
    "| V2 |    |    |    | 9  |    |    |\n",
    "| V3 |    |    |    |    | 7  | 3  |\n",
    "| V4 | 1  |    |    |    |    |    |\n",
    "| V5 |    |    | 1  |    | 8  |    |\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of the adjacency matrix is that it is simple, and for small graphs it is easy to see which nodes are connected to other nodes. **However, notice that most of the cells in the matrix are empty.**\n",
    "When most of the cells are empty we say that this matrix is **\"sparse\"**. A matrix is not a very efficient way to store sparse data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adjaceny matrix is a good implementation for a graph when the number of edges is large. But what does it means? How many edges would be needed to fill the matrix? Since there is one row and one column for every vertex in the grapth, the number of edges required to fill the matrix |V| square. A matrix is full when every vertex is connected to every other vertex. There is few problems that approach such level of connectivity.\n",
    "Here the focus will be on problem with sparsely connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An Adjacency List\n",
    "A more space-efficient way to implement a sparsely connected graph is to use an adjacency list. In an adjacency list implementation we keep a master list of all the vertices in the Graph Object and then each vertex object in the graph maintains a list of the other vertices that it is connected to.\n",
    "\n",
    "ADD the image adjlst.png\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation of the adjacency list\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use two dictionaries to implement the adjacency list in Python. Using two abstract datatype based two classes *Graph* which holds the master list of vertices\n",
    "and *Vertex*, which will represent each vertex in the the graph\n",
    "*Vertex* Class\n",
    "- uses a dict to keep track of the vertices to which it is connected, and the weight of each edge. This dictionary is called *connectedTo*\n",
    "- *addNeighbor* method is used to add a connection from this vertex to another\n",
    "- *getConnections* method returns all of the vertices in the adjacency list, as represented by the *connectedTo* instance variable.\n",
    "- *getWeight* method returns the weight of the edge from this vertex to the vertex passed as a parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vertex:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, key):\n",
    "    self.id = key\n",
    "    self.connectedTo={}\n",

    "Graph provides the following methods:\n",
    "- adding vertices to a graph\n",
    "- connecting one vertex to another\n",
    "- getVertices method returns the names of all of the vertices in the graph.\n",
    "- **__iter__** method to make it easy to iterate over all vertex objects in a particular graph.\n",
    "the two methods allow you to itereate over the vertices in a graph by name, or by the objects themselves.\n",

    "### The word Ladder Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition of the problem: The word ladder problem was invented in 1878 by Lewis Carroll, the author of Alice in wonderland. The objectif of the problem is to transform a given word for instance FOOL into another word for instance SAGE. Noted that the changes are done gradually by changing one letter at a time. At each step you must transform one word into another word, you are not allowed to transform a word into a non-word.\n",
    "Illustration:\n",
    "- FOOL\n",
    "- POOL\n",
    "- POLL\n",
    "- POLE\n",
    "- PALE\n",
    "- SALE\n",
    "- SAGE\n",
    "There are many variations of the word ladder puzzle. For example, you might be given a particular number of steps in which to accomplish the transformation, or you might need to use a particular word. in this section we are interested in figuring out the smallest number of transformations needed to turn the starting word into the ending word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the outline to solve the problem using Graph algorithm:\n",
    "- Represent the relationships between the words as a graph\n",
    "- Use the graph algorithm known as breadth first search to find an efficient path from the starting word to the ending word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building the Word ladder Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first problem is to figure out how to turn a large collection of words into a graph. what we would like is to have an edge from one word to another if the two words are only different by a single letter. If we can create such a graph, then any path from one word to another is a solution to the word ladder puzzle.\n",
    "Below there is an example of the graph with some words. Notice that the graph is an undirected graph and that the edges are uweighted.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we take the approach of comparing one word to every other word on the list is an O(n2) algorithm. For 5,100 words, n2 is more than 26 million comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other approach is to have bucket of words that are different by one letter only.\n",
    "For instance: (Word buckets for words that are different by one Letter)\n",
    "\n",
    "_OPE: POPE, ROPE, NOPE, HOPE, LOPE, MOPE, COPE\n",
    "P_PE: POPE, PIPE, PAPE\n",
    "PO_E: POPE, POLE, PORE, POSE POKE\n",
    "POP_: POPE, POPS\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement, this is Python we can define a dictionary with a key, the label i.e `_OPE` and the value, the list of the words of that bucket.\n",
    "Once we have the dictionary built we can create the graph. we start our graph by creating a vertex for each word in the graph. Then we create edges between all the vertices we find for word found under the same key in the dictionary\n",
