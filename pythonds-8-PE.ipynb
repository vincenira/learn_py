    "objectives:\n",
    "- To learn what a graph is and how it is used\n",
    "- To implement the graph abstract data type using multiple internal representation\n",
    "- To see how graph can be used to solve wide variety of problems\n",
    "Graphs can be used to represent many interesting things about our world, including systems of roads, airline flights from city to city, how the Internet is connected, or even the sequence of classes you must take to complete a major in computer science.\n",
    "## vocabulary and definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vertex**:\n",
    "A vertex(also called a \"node\") is a fundamental part of a graph. It can have a name, which we will call the \"key\". A vertex may also have additional information. we will call this additional information the \"payload.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edge**:\n",
    "An edge(also called an \"arc\") is another fundamental part of a graph. An edge connects two vertices to show that there is a relationship between them. Edges may be one-way or two-way. if the edges in a graph are all one-way, we way that the graph is **directed graph**, or a **digraph**. The class prerequisites graph show above is clearly a digraph since you must take some classes before others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weight**:\n",
    "Edges may be weighted to show that there is a cost to go from one vertex to another. For example in a graph of roads that connect one city to another, the weight on the edge might represent the distance between the two cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "With those definitions in hand we can formally define a graph. A graph can be represented by G where G = (V,E). For the graph G, V is a set of vertices and E is a set of edges. Each edge is a tuple(v,w) where w,v belongs to V. We can add a third component to the edge tuple to represent a weight. A subgraph s is a set of edges e and vertices v such that e is included into E and v is included into V.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent this graph as the set of six vertices:\n",
    "V = {V0, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5}\n",
    "\n",
    "and the set of nine edges:\n",
    "E = {(v0,v1,5),(v1,v2,4),(v2,v3,9),(v3,v4,7),(v4,v0,1),(v0,v5,2),(v5,v4,8),(v3,v5,3),(v5,v2,1)}\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "graph LR\n",
    "  V3 --|7| V4\n",
    "  V3 --|3| V5\n",
    "  V2 --|9| V3\n",
    "  V4 --|1| V0\n",
    "  V5 --|8| V4\n",
    "  V5 --|1| V2\n",
    "  V0 --|2| V5\n",
    "  V0 --|5| V1\n",
    "  V1 --|4| V2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Path**:\n",
    "A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices that are connected by edges. Formally we would define a path as w1, w2, ..., wn such that (wi,wi+1) belongs to E for all 1 <= i <=  n-1.  The unweighted path length is the number of edges in the path, specifically n-1. The weighted path length is the sum of the weights of all the edges in the path. For example in figure above the path from V3 to V1 is the sequence of vertices (V3, V4, V0, V1). The edges are {(v3,v4,7), (v4,v0,1), (v0,v1,5)}.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cycle**:\n",
    "A cycle in a directed graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. For example, in Figure above the path (V5, V2, V3, V5) is a cycle. A graph with no cycles is called an **acyclic graph**. A directed graph with no cycles is called a **directed acyclic graph** or a **DAG**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Graph Abstract Data Type\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph abstract data type (ADT) is defined as follows:\n",
    "- `Graph()` creates a new, empty graph.\n",
    "- `addVertex(vert)` adds an instance of `Vertex` to the graph.\n",
    "- `addEdge(fromVert, toVert)` Adds a new, weighted, directed edge to the graph that connects two vertices.\n",
    "- `getVertex(vertKey)` finds the vertex in the graph named `vertkey`\n",
    "- `getVertices()` returns the list of all vertices in the graph.\n",
    "- `in` returns `True` for a statement of the form `vertex in graph`. If the given vertex is in the graph, `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this above formal definition of a graph, there are several ways to implement the graph ADT in python. We will see that there are trade-offs in using different representations to implement the ADT described above.\n",
    "There are two well-known implementations of a graph, \n",
    "- **Adjacency matrix**\n",
    "- **Adjacency list**\n",
    "\n",
    "### An Adjacency Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the easiest ways to implement a graph is to use two-dimensional matrix, in this matrix implementation, each of the rows and columns represents a vertex in the graph. The value that is stored in the cell at the intersection of row v and column w indicates if there is an edge from vertex v to vertex w.\n",
    "**When two vertices are connected by an edge, we say that they are adjacent.** A value in a cell representes the weight of the edge from vertex v to vertex w.\n",
    "\n",
    "|    | V0 | V1 | V2 | v3 | V4 | v5 |\n",
    "|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n",
    "| V0 |    | 5  |    |    |    | 2  |\n",
    "| V1 |    |    | 4  |    |    |    |\n",
    "| V2 |    |    |    | 9  |    |    |\n",
    "| V3 |    |    |    |    | 7  | 3  |\n",
    "| V4 | 1  |    |    |    |    |    |\n",
    "| V5 |    |    | 1  |    | 8  |    |\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of the adjacency matrix is that it is simple, and for small graphs it is easy to see which nodes are connected to other nodes. **However, notice that most of the cells in the matrix are empty.**\n",
    "When most of the cells are empty we say that this matrix is **\"sparse\"**. A matrix is not a very efficient way to store sparse data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adjaceny matrix is a good implementation for a graph when the number of edges is large. But what does it means? How many edges would be needed to fill the matrix? Since there is one row and one column for every vertex in the grapth, the number of edges required to fill the matrix |V| square. A matrix is full when every vertex is connected to every other vertex. There is few problems that approach such level of connectivity.\n",
    "Here the focus will be on problem with sparsely connection.\n",
