    "objectives:\n",
    "- To learn what a graph is and how it is used\n",
    "- To implement the graph abstract data type using multiple internal representation\n",
    "- To see how graph can be used to solve wide variety of problems\n",
    "Graphs can be used to represent many interesting things about our world, including systems of roads, airline flights from city to city, how the Internet is connected, or even the sequence of classes you must take to complete a major in computer science.\n",
    "## vocabulary and definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vertex**:\n",
    "A vertex(also called a \"node\") is a fundamental part of a graph. It can have a name, which we will call the \"key\". A vertex may also have additional information. we will call this additional information the \"payload.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edge**:\n",
    "An edge(also called an \"arc\") is another fundamental part of a graph. An edge connects two vertices to show that there is a relationship between them. Edges may be one-way or two-way. if the edges in a graph are all one-way, we way that the graph is **directed graph**, or a **digraph**. The class prerequisites graph show above is clearly a digraph since you must take some classes before others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weight**:\n",
    "Edges may be weighted to show that there is a cost to go from one vertex to another. For example in a graph of roads that connect one city to another, the weight on the edge might represent the distance between the two cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "With those definitions in hand we can formally define a graph. A graph can be represented by G where G = (V,E). For the graph G, V is a set of vertices and E is a set of edges. Each edge is a tuple(v,w) where w,v belongs to V. We can add a third component to the edge tuple to represent a weight. A subgraph s is a set of edges e and vertices v such that e is included into E and v is included into V.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent this graph as the set of six vertices:\n",
    "V = {V0, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5}\n",
    "\n",
    "and the set of nine edges:\n",
    "E = {(v0,v1,5),(v1,v2,4),(v2,v3,9),(v3,v4,7),(v4,v0,1),(v0,v5,2),(v5,v4,8),(v3,v5,3),(v5,v2,1)}\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "graph LR\n",
    "  V3 --|7| V4\n",
    "  V3 --|3| V5\n",
    "  V2 --|9| V3\n",
    "  V4 --|1| V0\n",
    "  V5 --|8| V4\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Path**:\n",
    "A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices that are connected by edges. Formally we would define a path as w1, w2, ..., wn such that (wi,wi+1) belongs to E for all 1 <= i <=  n-1.  The unweighted path length is the number of edges in the path, specifically n-1. The weighted path length is the sum of the weights of all the edges in the path. For example in figure above the path from V3 to V1 is the sequence of vertices (V3, V4, V0, V1). The edges are {(v3,v4,7), (v4,v0,1), (v0,v1,5)}.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cycle**:\n",
    "A cycle in a directed graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. For example, in Figure above the path (V5, V2, V3, V5) is a cycle. A graph with no cycles is called an **acyclic graph**. A directed graph with no cycles is called a **directed acyclic graph** or a **DAG**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Graph Abstract Data Type\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph abstract data type (ADT) is defined as follows:\n",
    "- `Graph()` creates a new, empty graph.\n",
    "- `addVertex(vert)` adds an instance of `Vertex` to the graph.\n",
    "- `addEdge(fromVert, toVert)` Adds a new, weighted, directed edge to the graph that connects two vertices.\n",
    "- `getVertex(vertKey)` finds the vertex in the graph named `vertkey`\n",
    "- `getVertices()` returns the list of all vertices in the graph.\n",
    "- `in` returns `True` for a statement of the form `vertex in graph`. If the given vertex is in the graph, `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this above formal definition of a graph, there are several ways to implement the graph ADT in python. We will see that there are trade-offs in using different representations to implement the ADT described above.\n",
    "There are two well-known implementations of a graph, \n",
    "- **Adjacency matrix**\n",
    "- **Adjacency list**\n",
    "\n",
    "### An Adjacency Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the easiest ways to implement a graph is to use two-dimensional matrix, in this matrix implementation, each of the rows and columns represents a vertex in the graph. The value that is stored in the cell at the intersection of row v and column w indicates if there is an edge from vertex v to vertex w.\n",
    "**When two vertices are connected by an edge, we say that they are adjacent.** A value in a cell representes the weight of the edge from vertex v to vertex w.\n",
    "\n",
    "|    | V0 | V1 | V2 | v3 | V4 | v5 |\n",
    "|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n",
    "| V0 |    | 5  |    |    |    | 2  |\n",
    "| V1 |    |    | 4  |    |    |    |\n",
    "| V2 |    |    |    | 9  |    |    |\n",
    "| V3 |    |    |    |    | 7  | 3  |\n",
    "| V4 | 1  |    |    |    |    |    |\n",
    "| V5 |    |    | 1  |    | 8  |    |\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of the adjacency matrix is that it is simple, and for small graphs it is easy to see which nodes are connected to other nodes. **However, notice that most of the cells in the matrix are empty.**\n",
    "When most of the cells are empty we say that this matrix is **\"sparse\"**. A matrix is not a very efficient way to store sparse data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adjaceny matrix is a good implementation for a graph when the number of edges is large. But what does it means? How many edges would be needed to fill the matrix? Since there is one row and one column for every vertex in the grapth, the number of edges required to fill the matrix |V| square. A matrix is full when every vertex is connected to every other vertex. There is few problems that approach such level of connectivity.\n",
    "Here the focus will be on problem with sparsely connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An Adjacency List\n",
    "A more space-efficient way to implement a sparsely connected graph is to use an adjacency list. In an adjacency list implementation we keep a master list of all the vertices in the Graph Object and then each vertex object in the graph maintains a list of the other vertices that it is connected to.\n",
    "\n",
    "ADD the image adjlst.png\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation of the adjacency list\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use two dictionaries to implement the adjacency list in Python. Using two abstract datatype based two classes *Graph* which holds the master list of vertices\n",
    "and *Vertex*, which will represent each vertex in the the graph\n",
    "*Vertex* Class\n",
    "- uses a dict to keep track of the vertices to which it is connected, and the weight of each edge. This dictionary is called *connectedTo*\n",

    "- *getConnections* method returns all of the vertices in the adjacency list, as represented by the *connectedTo* instance variable.\n",
    "- *getWeight* method returns the weight of the edge from this vertex to the vertex passed as a parameter.\n",

    "### The word Ladder Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition of the problem: The word ladder problem was invented in 1878 by Lewis Carroll, the author of Alice in wonderland. The objectif of the problem is to transform a given word for instance FOOL into another word for instance SAGE. Noted that the changes are done gradually by changing one letter at a time. At each step you must transform one word into another word, you are not allowed to transform a word into a non-word.\n",
    "Illustration:\n",
    "- FOOL\n",
    "- POOL\n",
    "- POLL\n",
    "- POLE\n",
    "- PALE\n",
    "- SALE\n",
    "- SAGE\n",
    "There are many variations of the word ladder puzzle. For example, you might be given a particular number of steps in which to accomplish the transformation, or you might need to use a particular word. in this section we are interested in figuring out the smallest number of transformations needed to turn the starting word into the ending word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the outline to solve the problem using Graph algorithm:\n",
    "- Represent the relationships between the words as a graph\n",
    "- Use the graph algorithm known as breadth first search to find an efficient path from the starting word to the ending word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building the Word ladder Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first problem is to figure out how to turn a large collection of words into a graph. what we would like is to have an edge from one word to another if the two words are only different by a single letter. If we can create such a graph, then any path from one word to another is a solution to the word ladder puzzle.\n",
    "Below there is an example of the graph with some words. Notice that the graph is an undirected graph and that the edges are uweighted.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we take the approach of comparing one word to every other word on the list is an O(n2) algorithm. For 5,100 words, n2 is more than 26 million comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other approach is to have bucket of words that are different by one letter only.\n",
    "For instance: (Word buckets for words that are different by one Letter)\n",
    "\n",
    "_OPE: POPE, ROPE, NOPE, HOPE, LOPE, MOPE, COPE\n",
    "P_PE: POPE, PIPE, PAPE\n",
    "PO_E: POPE, POLE, PORE, POSE POKE\n",
    "POP_: POPE, POPS\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement, this is Python we can define a dictionary with a key, the label i.e `_OPE` and the value, the list of the words of that bucket.\n",
    "Once we have the dictionary built we can create the graph. we start our graph by creating a vertex for each word in the graph. Then we create edges between all the vertices we find for word found under the same key in the dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pythonds.graphs import Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "def buildGraph(wordFile):\n",

    "### Implementing the Breadth First Search\n",
    "To help us find the shortest solution to the word ladder problem. we will use the graph algorithm called \"breadth first search\" algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a graph G and a starting vertex s, a breadth first search proceeds by exploring edges in the graph to find all the vertices in G for which there is a path from s. The remarkable thing about a breadth first search is that it finds all the vertices that are a distance k from s before it finds any vertices that are a distance k+1. One good way to visualize what the breadth first search algorithm does is to imagine that it is building a tree, one level of the tree at a time. A breadth first search adds all children of the starting vertex before it begins to discover any of the grandchildren.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep track of its progress, BFS colors each of the vertices white, gray or black. All the vertices are initialized to white when they are constructed. A white vertex is an undiscovered vertex. When a vertex is initially discovered it is colored gray, and when BFS has completely explored a vertex it is colored black.\n",
    "This means that once a vertex is colored black, it has no white vertices adjacent to it. A gray node, on the other hand, may have some white vertices adjacent to it, indicating that there are still additional vertices to explore\n",
    "Note that BFS uses a `Queue`, a crucial point as we will see, to decide which vertex to explore next.\n",
    "\n",
    "BFS begins at the starting vertex s and colors start gray to show that it is currently being explored. Two other values, the distance and the predecessor, are initialized to 0 and None respectively for the starting vertex. Finally, start is placed on a Queue. The next step is to begin to systematically explore vertices at the front of the queue. We explore each new node at the front of the queue by iterating over its adjacency list. As each node on the adjacency list is examined its color is checked. If it is white, the vertex is unexplored, and four things happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The new, unexplored vertex nbr, is colored gray.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The predecessor of nbr is set to the current node currentVert\n",
    "\n",
    "    The distance to nbr is set to the distance to currentVert + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    nbr is added to the end of a queue. Adding nbr to the end of the queue effectively schedules this node for further exploration, but not until all the other vertices on the adjacency list of currentVert have been explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pythonds.graphs import Graph, Vertex\n",
    "from pythonds.basic import Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "def bfs(g, start):\n",
    "  start.setDistance(0)\n",
    "  start.setPred(None)\n",
    "  vertQueue = Queue()\n",
    "  vertQueue.enqueue(start)\n",
    "  while (vertQueue.size() > 0):\n",
    "    currentVert = vertQueue.dequeue()\n",
    "    for nbr in currentVert.getConnections():\n",
    "      if (nbr.getColor() == 'white'):\n",
    "        nbr.setColor('gray')\n",
    "        nbr.setDistance(currentVert.getDistance() + 1)\n",
    "        nbr.setPred(currentVert)\n",
    "        vertQueue.enqueue(nbr)\n",
    "    currentVert.setColor('black')\n",
    "```\n",
    "The amazing thing about the breadth first search solution is that we have not only solved the FOOL-SAGE problem we started out with, but we have solved many other problems along the way. We can start at any vertex in the breadth first search tree and follow the predecessor arrows back to the root to find the shortest word ladder form any word back to fool\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def traverse(y):\n",
    "  x = y\n",
    "  while (x.getPred()):\n",
    "    print(x.getId())\n",
    "    x = x.getPred()\n",
    "  print(x.getId())\n",
    "\n",
    "traverse(g.getVertex('sage'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Breadth First Search Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we continue with other graph algorithms let us analyze the run time performance of the breadth first search algorithm. The first thing to observe is that the while loop is executed, at most, one time for each vertex in the graph |v|. You can see that this is true because a vertex must be white before it can be examined and added to the queue. This gives us O(V) for the while loop. The for loop, which is nested inside the while is executed at most once for each edge in the graph, |E|. The reason is that every vertex is dequeued at most once and we examine an edge from node U to node V only when node is dequeued. This gives us O(E)for the for loop. combining the two loops gives us O(V + E)\n",
    "Of course doing the breadth first search is only part of the task. Following the links from the starting node to the goal node is the other part of the task. The worst case for this would be if the graph was a single long chain. In this case traversing through all of the vertices would be O(V). The normal case is going to be some fraction of |V| but we would still write O(V)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, at least for this problem, there is the time required to build the initial graph. We leave the analysis of the buildGraph function as an exercise for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The knight's Tour Problem\n",
    "Another classic problem that we can use to illustrate a second common graph algorithm is called the “knight’s tour.” The knight’s tour puzzle is played on a chess board with a single chess piece, the knight. The object of the puzzle is to find a sequence of moves that allow the knight to visit every square on the board exactly once. One such sequence is called a “tour.” The knight’s tour puzzle has fascinated chess players, mathematicians and computer scientists alike for many years. The upper bound on the number of possible legal tours for an eight-by-eight chessboard is known to be 1.305 x 10^35; however, there are even more possible dead ends. Clearly this is a problem that requires some real brains, some real computing power, or both.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will used the graph search which is one of the easiest to understand and program. Once again we will solve the problem using two main steps:\n",
    "- Represent the legal moves of a knight on a chessboard as a graph.\n",
    "- Use a graph algorithm to find a path of length rows * columns - 1 where every vertex on the graph is visited exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Building the knight's Tour graph\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent the knight's tour problem as a graph we will use the following two ideas:\n",
    "- Each square on the chessboard can be represented as a node in the graph\n",
    "- Each legal move by the knight can be represented as an edge in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build the full graph for a n-by-n board we can use the Python function. \n",
    "- `knightGraph` function makes one pass over the entire board\n",
    "- At each square on the board the `knightGraph` function calls a helper\n",
    "- `genLegalMoves`, to create a list of legal moves for that position on the board\n",
    "- All legal moves are then converted into edges in the graph. \n",
    "- Another helper function `posToNodeId` converts a location on the board in the terms of a row and a column into a linear vertex number similar to the vertex numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "### knight's Tour Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen that the number of nodes in a binary tree of height N is 2^N+1 -1. For a tree with nodes that may have up to eight children instead of two the number of nodes is much large. Because the branching factor of each node is variable, we could estimate the number of nodes using an average branching factor\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explaining the branching factor\n",
    "The \"branching factor\" in a graph tree (or more broadly, a tree data structure or search tree) refers to the **number of children at each node**. It essentially quantifies how \"bushy\" or \"wide\" a tree is.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is it Calculated?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways to think about it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Uniform Branching Factor:** If every non-leaf node in the tree has the exact same number of children, then that number is the branching factor. For example, a binary tree always has a branching factor of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Average Branching Factor:** In many real-world scenarios (like game trees, decision trees, or search trees for AI problems), the number of children can vary from node to node. In such cases, we calculate an **average branching factor**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The most common way to calculate the average branching factor is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\\text{Average Branching Factor} = \\frac{\\text{Total number of non-root nodes (or edges)}}{\\text{Total number of non-leaf nodes (nodes with children)}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    Essentially, it's the total number of \"branches\" extending from parent nodes, divided by the number of nodes that *have* children.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Maximum Branching Factor:** Sometimes, you might be interested in the maximum number of children any single node has in the tree. This is particularly relevant for analyzing worst-case scenarios in algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is it Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "The branching factor is a critical metric because it directly impacts:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Complexity of Algorithms:** Algorithms that traverse trees (like Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, or Minimax for game playing) are heavily influenced by the branching factor. A higher branching factor leads to an exponentially larger search space, causing what's known as \"combinatorial explosion.\"\n",
    "  * **Memory Usage:** A wider tree means more nodes at each level, which can require more memory to store.\n",
    "  * **Performance:** Higher branching factors can make search algorithms computationally more expensive, requiring more time to explore all possible paths. Techniques like alpha-beta pruning in game AI aim to reduce the *effective* branching factor by eliminating branches that don't need to be explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Illustration:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate with an example tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "          A (Root)\n",
    "         / | \\\n",
    "        B  C  D\n",
    "       / \\    / \\\n",
    "      E   F  G   H\n",
    "     /\n",
    "    I\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Node A** has 3 children (B, C, D).\n",
    "  * **Node B** has 2 children (E, F).\n",
    "  * **Node C** has 0 children (it's a leaf).\n",
    "  * **Node D** has 2 children (G, H).\n",
    "  * **Node E** has 1 child (I).\n",
    "  * **Nodes F, G, H, I** are all leaf nodes (0 children).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's calculate the average branching factor:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Non-root nodes (or edges):** Count all nodes except the root 'A', or count all the edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Nodes: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I = 8 non-root nodes.\n",
    "      * Edges: (A,B), (A,C), (A,D), (B,E), (B,F), (D,G), (D,H), (E,I) = 8 edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Non-leaf nodes (nodes with children):** These are the nodes that have outgoing branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Nodes: A, B, D, E = 4 non-leaf nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Average Branching Factor Calculation:**\n",
    "    $$\\text{Average Branching Factor} = \\frac{\\text{Number of non-root nodes}}{\\text{Number of non-leaf nodes}} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for this tree, the average branching factor is **2**. Even though some nodes have 3 or 1 child, on average, each non-leaf node has 2 children.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to consider the **maximum branching factor** for this tree, it would be **3** (from node A).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explain the heuristic\n",
    "The problem with using the vertex with the most available moves as your next vertex on the path is that it tends to have the knight visit the middle \n",
    "squares early on in the tour. When this happens it is easy for the knight to get stranded on one side of the board where it cannot reach unvisited squares \n",
    "on the other side of the board. On the other hand, visiting the squares with the fewest available moves first pushes the knight to visit the squares around the \n",
    "edges of the board first. This ensures that the knight will visit the hard-to-reach corners early and can use the middle squares to hop across the board only when necessary.\n",
    "Utilizing this kind of knowledge to speed up an algorithm is called a heuristic.\n",
    "Humans use heuristics every day to help make decisions, heuristic searches are often used in the field of artificial intelligence. \n",
    "This particular heuristic is called Warnsdorff’s algorithm, named after H. C. Warnsdorff who published his idea in 1823.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def orderByAvail(n):\n",
    "    resList = []\n",
    "    for v in n.getConnections():\n",
    "        if v.getColor() == 'white':\n",

    "                if w.getColor() == 'white':\n",
    "                    c = c + 1\n",
    "            resList.append((c,v))\n",
    "    resList.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n",
    "    return [y[1] for y in resList]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Depth First Search\n",
    "\n",
    "The knight's tour is a special case of a depth first search where the goal is to create the deepest depth first tree, without any branches.\n",
    "It is even possible that a depth first search will create more than one tree. When the depth first search algorithm creates a group of trees we call this **depth first forest**\n",
    "The new instance variables are the **discovery and finish times**. The **discovery time** tracks the number of steps in the algorithm before a vertex is first encountered. the **finish time** is the number of steps in the algorithm before a vertex is colored black.\n",
    "Two functions dfs and its helper dfsvisit use a variable to keep track of the time across calls to dfsvisit we chose to implement the code as methods of a class that inherits from the **Graph** class. This implementation extends the graph class by adding a **time** instance variable and the two methods **dfs** and **dfsvisit**\n",

    "The **dfsvisit** method start with a single vertex called **startVertex** and explores all of the neighboring white vertices as deeply as possible. if you look carefully at the code for **dfsvisit** and compare it to breadth first search, what you should notice is that the **dfsvisit** algorithm is almost identical to **bfs** except that on the last line of the inner **for** loop, **dfsvisit** calls itself recursively to continue the search at a deeper level, whereas **bfs** adds the node to a queue for later exploration. It is interesting to note that where **bfs** uses a queue, **dfsvisit** uses a stack.\n",

In **dfsvisit** the loop is executed once for each edge in the adjacency list of the current vertex. since **dfsvisit** is only called recursively if the vertex is white, the loop will execute a maximun of once for every edge in the graph or O(E),\n",
